description: Integrate the Ludeo SDK into a Unity (C#) game using the Ludeo Unity plugin. Sets up the package install + scripting defines, wires the SDK lifecycle through MonoBehaviour/scene flow, maps and implements game actions, maps and tracks GameObjects as attributes, restores state for playable Ludeos, and verifies the integration. Use when the user asks to integrate, install, add, set up, or wire up Ludeo into their Unity game.

# Ludeo SDK Integration for Unity

**Skill version:** 1.1.0 · Compare against the [latest release](https://github.com/ludeo-labs/integration-skills/releases/latest) to confirm your installed copy is current. If older, run `npx skills update ludeo-labs/integration-skills/skills/ludeo-unity` (then start a fresh agent session — `SKILL.md` is cached per session).

This skill walks the agent through integrating the Ludeo SDK into a **Unity** game using the
**Ludeo Unity plugin** (the managed `LudeoSDK` C# API), from package install through action mapping,
object tracking, state restoration, and runtime verification.

> **This is the Unity-specific skill.** For C++/proprietary engines, use `ludeo-unreal-integration`
> instead. The two share the same workflow methodology; everything here is expressed in Unity/C#
> idioms (MonoBehaviour lifecycle, scenes, prefabs, the `LudeoSDK` managed API).

> **Recommend a frontier model before starting.** Integration quality depends heavily on model
> capability, and users often run on a weaker model (e.g. Sonnet). At the **start of the integration**,
> recommend the user switch to **Opus 4.8** (or an equivalent frontier model) before proceeding.

## When to use

Activate this skill when the user says any of:

- "Integrate Ludeo into my Unity game"
- "Set up the Ludeo SDK in Unity"
- "Add Ludeo action tracking" (Unity project)
- "Build my Unity game with the Ludeo SDK"
- "Wire up the Ludeo lifecycle in Unity"

If the project is **not** Unity (no `Assets/`, `ProjectSettings/`, `Packages/manifest.json`, or
`.asmdef`/`.unity` files), stop and point the user at the engine-appropriate skill.

## Read this first

**Do not apply C++/main-loop assumptions to a Unity project** — they will send you looking for
things that don't exist (a `main`, a game-authored loop, a build script) and miss the things that
do (scenes, MonoBehaviour callbacks, prefabs, an installed package). The full Unity structural model
and the codebase-scan search patterns live in **phase 1** (`references/1-map-game-code.md`); each
later phase bakes in the Unity reality it needs.

Review **`references/ludeo-integration-docs/00-CRITICAL-REQUIREMENTS.md`** before phase 0 — the
mandatory rules, recalibrated for the C# wrapper.

## Workflow

The integration is a sequential workflow, now sequenced by the **8-phase guideline order** (the table's
**Phase** column), not the legacy file numbers (renumbering is deferred).
The order is: **0** install + intake → **1** map code → **2** SDK lifecycle → **3** map objects → **4**
tracking & restore (an **iterative wave loop** that turns a capture into a playable Ludeo — Wave 1 = the
restorable spine, then widen) → **5** actions → **6** validate + upload. Note **actions (phase 5) run AFTER
tracking & restore (phase 4)** per the guideline — the player flow is proven (Wave 1 restores) before action
enrichment. Always start at phase 0 unless the user says they've completed earlier phases.
Complete one phase at a time and confirm with the user before advancing.

**Phases 2, 4, and 5 are orchestrated.** Each is one logical guideline phase made of single-task briefs,
run by a thin orchestrator that dispatches one **subagent per task** (Agent tool) and passes artifacts by
file — so the user experiences each as a single phase.
- **Phase 2** ("plan & implement the SDK lifecycle") follows `references/2-lifecycle-orchestrator.md`:
  tasks 1–4 run automatically, the compile+run gate is surfaced to the human.
- **Phase 4** ("tracking & restore") follows `references/9-tracking-restore-orchestrator.md` and runs as an
  **iterative wave loop**: phase 3 produces a *census + wave plan*, and phase 4 implements it **one wave at
  a time** — per wave: deep-scope (task 0) → capture (task 1) → restore-plan (task 2) → reconstruction (task
  4), with the restore-**flow** (task 3) built **once in Wave 1**. **Wave 1** proves the full capture→replay
  round-trip on the *restorable spine + must-have set*; each later wave widens the tracked set. **Every**
  sub-task ends in a human gate the orchestrator runs (the agent can't see the Console, and the
  capture/replay gates require the human to capture/play a Ludeo); on a failed gate it re-dispatches a fix
  subagent with the logs — re-opening an **earlier wave** if the failure traces to its state.
- **Phase 5** ("actions") follows `references/6-actions-orchestrator.md`: map → implement, then one human
  compile+log gate (each action must emit in **both** the Creator and Player flow).

## Important rules

- **One phase at a time.** Get user confirmation before advancing to the next phase.
- **Every code-writing phase ends with a recompile + run gate (hard requirement).** The files that edit
  `.cs` (`4`, `7`, `9`, `11`, `12`) each end by requiring the integrator to (1) focus the Editor to
  recompile clean and (2) play the game to confirm it still runs. Unity recompiles on focus, so "compile"
  is a per-phase reality, not a one-time milestone. **For the orchestrated phases (2, 4, and 5) the
  orchestrator runs these gates** — it dispatches the codegen subagent (which does not compile), then
  surfaces the recompile/play gate to the human and re-dispatches a fix subagent with the logs on failure.
  The agent reads `Editor.log`/`Player.log` where it can but cannot truly verify either step — beyond the
  log it relies on the integrator's word. Do not advance until they confirm both (or explicitly skip). The
  compile-and-fix loop + `error CS` table live in `phase 5`; the gate cites it rather than repeating it.
- **Unity mental model first.** Internalize the "Read this first" model above (and phase 1's "How a
  Unity game is structured") before phase 0, and treat every search/instruction through it.
- **Track objects as attributes by default, not blobs.** The SDK supports both; Ludeo strongly
  prefers attribute integrations. When mapping and tracking objects (phases 3–4), capture discrete
  typed attributes (`SetAttribute(name, int/float/bool/string/Vector3/Quaternion)`) by default and
  do **not** ask the user which to use. Use blob/`byte[]` storage only when the user explicitly asks
  or an entity is genuinely opaque — see `06-TRACKING-PATTERNS.md`.
- **The SDK ticks itself.** The plugin instantiates a `LudeoUnityManager` that drives the SDK Tick.
  Do **not** wire SDK Tick into an Update loop. The game only drives its own `UpdateStateObjects()`
  attribute-sampling cadence.
- **Prefer the Ludeo layer; edit few game files when you can (a preference, not a hard rule).**
  **Integration correctness comes first** — never contort the integration, skip a needed hook, or fight the
  game's architecture just to avoid touching game code. That said, when there's a clean choice, keep logic
  in the game's Ludeo integration folder (the `[Layer]` classes — `unity/REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md`) and
  keep edits to the game's own source small and mechanical (ideally a single façade call or event
  subscription). Fewer, smaller game-file edits make the integration easier to review, isolate, and remove
  — strive for it, but let correctness win whenever the two pull apart.
- **Disabling Ludeo is primarily a runtime concern, not conditional compilation.** Once the package
  is installed it is auto-referenced (no asmdef wiring needed). Route all SDK use through interfaces
  so that consent-off / uninitialized states fall back to `Dummy*`/`Disabled*` implementations and
  the game plays normally. A scripting define (e.g. `LUDEO_SDK`) is **optional** — only if you must
  ship builds that exclude the SDK package entirely.
- **Never claim SDK behavior without checking the docs.** Search the `sdk-docs` MCP server (see
  *MCP configuration* below) or read the bundled `references/ludeo-integration-docs/`. If neither
  covers it, say what you're unsure about rather than guessing.
- **Paths inside workflow files are relative to the workflow file itself.** A workflow at
  `references/N-*.md` says `ludeo-integration-docs/<file>.md` to reach the docs folder.
- **The agent writes outputs into the game's Unity project**, not into this skill. For example,
  `ludeo-integration-plan/CODE_MAP.json` is created at the Unity project root.
- **Fresh session recommended.** Each phase produces a lot of context. If a phase has been running
  long, suggest the user start a fresh agent session for the next phase.

## Reference material

- `references/ludeo-integration-docs/` — primary integration guides (build, lifecycle, tracking,
  restoration, API reference, research templates, game-pattern playbooks), all Unity/C#.
- `references/ludeo-integration-docs/unity/` — Unity-specific material:
  - `REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md` — the prescribed integration layer (`LudeoController` /
    `LudeoFlowSwitch` / `LudeoGameplaySessionManager` / `ILudeoStateHandler` / `LudeoKeys`).
  - `UPM-INSTALL-AND-DEFINES.md` — install paths, scripting defines, the dummy-impl pattern.
  - `LAUNCH-AND-READINESS.md` — launch models (menu-gated vs. boot-straight-to-gameplay) + the
    SDK-readiness gate that replaces the menu's implicit Activate/consent wait.
  - `CONSENT-AND-OVERLAY.md` — consent gating, gallery, pause/resume overlay notifications.
  - `READING-UNITY-LOGS.md` — locating and reading `Editor.log` / `Player.log` for the compile/run gates.

## MCP configuration

The skill's primary, always-current source of SDK detail is the **`sdk-docs`** MCP server — it
**searches the Ludeo SDK documentation** (API reference, method signatures, callback chains; Unity/C#
included). It ships with the skill (`config/mcp_config.template.json`) and runs on the integrator's
machine. Set it up once, before doing any SDK work.

> **If `sdk-docs` is not already connected**, wire it up from the bundled template, then continue. It
> is hosted (HTTP) at `https://ludeo-mcps-sdk-docs.ludeo.com/mcp` and needs an `X-User-Name` header
> set to your Ludeo username (the local-part of your Ludeo email, e.g. `jane.doe`) — it identifies the
> caller.
> - **Claude Code:** copy the `sdk-docs` entry from `<skill-base-dir>/config/mcp_config.template.json`
>   into the project's `.mcp.json` (or run `claude mcp add`), set `X-User-Name` to your Ludeo username,
>   then start a fresh session so the server connects.
> - **Other agents:** add the same entry to your runtime's MCP config.
> - If you cannot connect it, tell the user and fall back to the bundled
>   `references/ludeo-integration-docs/` — but **say so explicitly**, since the bundled copy can drift
>   from the live SDK.

| Server | Hosted endpoint | Purpose | Fallback |
|--------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| `sdk-docs` | `https://ludeo-mcps-sdk-docs.ludeo.com/mcp` (HTTP, `X-User-Name` header) | **Search the Ludeo SDK documentation** | Bundled `references/ludeo-integration-docs/` |
| `ludeo-context` | `https://mcp-ludeo-context-internal.ludeo.com/mcp` (HTTP, bearer token) | Company knowledge, QA workflows, repo context | Proceed without; analysis quality may be reduced |

## Start here

Read `references/0-build-game-with-sdk.md` and follow it. (Phase 1 establishes the full Unity
structural model and search patterns once you reach codebase mapping.)
