# RPG Genre Patterns (Unity)

> **Applies to:** Action RPGs, open-world RPGs (Daggerfall, Skyrim/Fallout-likes, Witcher-likes),
> JRPGs with real-time combat, MMORPGs, looter-RPGs (Diablo-likes)
> **Load when:** Game involves character stats/leveling, quests, inventory/equipment, dialogue, or
> faction/reputation systems
>
> **Most RPGs are also open-world / streaming.** If the game has no per-level scenes, load
> [open-world.md](./open-world.md) (session boundaries) and
> [open-world-tracking.md](./open-world-tracking.md) (streaming-world tracking) **alongside** this
> file — this file is the genre catalog; those are the structural shape.
>
> Action names below map to `[SDK]` `LudeoGameplaySession.SendAction(string)` via the `[Layer]`
> `LudeoController.SendAction` (see `phase 7`).

## 1. Actions Catalog

> **Candidates, not a capture list.** The **Tier** column ranks capture priority for *this* genre;
> still apply phase 6's keep test before sending any action.
> - **T1 — Capture:** signature scored milestones / one-shot highlights that define the genre.
> - **T2 — Capture if scored or a notable beat in *this* game;** otherwise drop.
> - **T3 — Usually drop:** tracked **state** or high-frequency noise — capturing bloats the Ludeo.
>   Keep only if exceptionally scored. (Rows with both Objective and Scoring empty are almost always T3.)
>
> **Genre T3 traps:** `GainXP` (XP total is tracked **state**; fires on every kill), `Equip` (equipped
> gear is tracked state), and `DialogueChoice`/`UseConsumable`/`Purchase`/`Sell` unless scored.
>
> **Scope (phase 6) — orthogonal to tier:** RPG beats are **almost all player-scoped** (mostly
> single-player) — `Kill`, `Death`, `LevelUp`, `QuestComplete`, `BossKill`. Guard any combat site that
> can fire for a non-player actor; genuinely global events are rare here.

## 2. Search Keywords

Grep these in C# method/field names and comments. Group results by category. In Unity, combat and
interaction frequently route through **physics callbacks** (`OnTriggerEnter`/`OnCollisionEnter`) and
**event hooks** (`UnityEvent`, C# `event`/`Action`, `On*`/`Handle*` handlers) — search those too.

## 3. Tracking Checklist

After object tracking is implemented (phase 9), verify these are covered. Types map to `[SDK]`
`SetAttribute` overloads (see `12-SDK-API-REFERENCE.md`). For streaming worlds, also apply
[open-world-tracking.md](./open-world-tracking.md) (track the loaded neighborhood + world/cell state,
not the whole save). Sections are tiered by restoration priority:
- **CRITICAL** — restore or the replayed moment is visibly wrong.
- **IMPORTANT** — restore for fidelity; recognizable without it but degraded.
- **OPTIONAL** — situational/cosmetic; capture only if it affects the specific captured moment.

### Player — CRITICAL
- [ ] Position (`Vector3`), Rotation (`Quaternion`)
- [ ] Health / HP, Mana / Magicka, Stamina/Fatigue (`int`/`float`)
- [ ] Is alive/dead (`bool`)
- [ ] Level, XP, attributes/skills (current values)
- [ ] Equipped gear (weapon, armor — by item/content id, not reference)
- [ ] Inventory (array of item ids + counts; never object references — `06 §9.4`)
- [ ] Gold / currency
- [ ] Current region/cell id (open-world)
- [ ] Faction reputation / standing

### NPCs / Enemies — IMPORTANT
- [ ] Position, rotation, health
- [ ] AI state (idle, combat, fleeing, schedule) — often `NavMeshAgent` + state enum
- [ ] Disposition / faction / is-hostile
- [ ] Target entity (by stable key)
- [ ] Dialogue/quest state if it gates behavior
- [ ] Is alive/dead (a killed-not-respawned NPC is a **state flag**, not just an unregister — `06 §9.4`)

### Quests / World State — IMPORTANT (world flags that gate the visible moment are CRITICAL)
- [ ] Active quest ids + current stage/objective (as their own objectType)
- [ ] World/global flags that affect the visible moment
- [ ] Game-time, weather, season (a `WorldState` singleton — `open-world-tracking.md §3`)

### Items / Containers / World objects — OPTIONAL
- [ ] Dropped/world items: position, item type, owner key
- [ ] Containers/chests: opened/looted state, contents
- [ ] Doors / locks: open, locked state
- [ ] Lootable corpses: looted state
