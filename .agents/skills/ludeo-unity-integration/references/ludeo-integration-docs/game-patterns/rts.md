# RTS Genre Patterns (Unity)

> **Applies to:** Real-Time Strategy, Tower Defense, Base Builders, MOBA (partial)
> **Load when:** Game involves unit production, base building, resource management, strategic combat
>
> Action names below map to `[SDK]` `LudeoGameplaySession.SendAction(string)` via the `[Layer]`
> `LudeoController.SendAction` (see `phase 7`).

## 1. Actions Catalog

> **Candidates, not a capture list.** The **Tier** column ranks capture priority for *this* genre;
> still apply phase 6's keep test before sending any action.
> - **T1 — Capture:** signature scored milestones / one-shot highlights that define the genre.
> - **T2 — Capture if scored or a notable beat in *this* game;** otherwise drop.
> - **T3 — Usually drop:** tracked **state** or high-frequency noise — capturing bloats the Ludeo.
>   Keep only if exceptionally scored. (Rows with both Objective and Scoring empty are almost always T3.)
>
> **Genre T3 traps:** the whole **Player Commands** group (`AttackOrder`/`MoveOrder`/`GroupSelect` fire
> on every click — the classic RTS bloat source) and `ResourceCollect`/`ResourceSpend`/`WorkerCreated`
> (resource totals are tracked **state** and collection ticks every second).
>
> **Scope (phase 6) — orthogonal to tier:** player(side)-scoped — `BuildStructure`, `UnitKill`,
> `HeroKill`, `CapturePoint`, `Research` (count for *your* units/orders; an enemy's kill is `UnitLost`);
> **global** (no guard, fire once) — `MatchWin`, `WaveComplete`, `ObjectiveComplete`.

## 2. Search Keywords

Grep these in C# method/field names and comments. In Unity, selection/orders often route through
input + raycast (`OnMouseDown`, `Physics.Raycast`, `InputAction`), and production/destruction through
`Instantiate`/`Destroy` and `UnityEvent`/`On*` handlers — search those too.

### Units / Entities / Spawning
```
unit, troop, soldier, army, squad, group, formation
spawn, produce, create, train, recruit, summon, deploy, Instantiate
destroy, kill, die, death, eliminate, remove, OnDestroy
hero, champion, commander, leader
worker, harvester, gatherer, villager, peasant, drone, probe, scv
```

### Buildings / Structures / Construction
```
build, construct, place, erect, foundation
structure, building, tower, wall, gate, barracks, factory
upgrade, level, tier, tech, evolve, improve
demolish, raze, dismantle, sell
defense, turret, cannon, fortification
```

### Resources / Economy
```
resource, gold, wood, stone, food, mineral, gas, supply, mana, energy
harvest, gather, mine, collect, extract
cost, afford, spend, buy, purchase, invest
income, rate, production, economy
trade, market, exchange
population, supply, capacity, limit, cap
```

### Territory / Map Control
```
capture, control, occupy, claim, contest, neutral
territory, zone, region, sector, point, node, base
flag, beacon, outpost, expansion
minimap, fog, reveal, scout, explore, vision
```

### Combat / Orders
```

## 3. Tracking Checklist

After object tracking is implemented (phase 9), verify these are covered. Types map to `[SDK]`
`SetAttribute` overloads (see `12-SDK-API-REFERENCE.md`). Sections are tiered by restoration priority:
- **CRITICAL** — restore or the replayed moment is visibly wrong.
- **IMPORTANT** — restore for fidelity; recognizable without it but degraded.
- **OPTIONAL** — situational/cosmetic; capture only if it affects the specific captured moment.

### Player State — CRITICAL
- [ ] Resources (each type: gold, wood, etc.)
- [ ] Population / supply (current and cap)
- [ ] Tech level / age / era
- [ ] Score
- [ ] Team / faction

### Units — CRITICAL (the army *is* the moment in an RTS)
- [ ] Position (`Vector3`)
- [ ] Unit type / prefab ID
- [ ] Health / HP
- [ ] Owner / player ID
- [ ] Current order / AI state (idle, moving, attacking, gathering)
- [ ] Target entity ID
- [ ] Is alive

### Structures / Buildings — IMPORTANT
- [ ] Position
- [ ] Building type
- [ ] Health
- [ ] Owner / player ID
- [ ] Build progress (0.0 to 1.0)
- [ ] Is complete
- [ ] Upgrade level
- [ ] Production queue (if producing units)

### Resources / Economy — IMPORTANT
- [ ] Resource node positions
- [ ] Resource node remaining amount
- [ ] Player resource totals (each type)

### Map / Territory — OPTIONAL
- [ ] Control point ownership
- [ ] Fog of war state (per player)
- [ ] Explored areas

### Environment — OPTIONAL
- [ ] Destructible terrain (if applicable)
- [ ] Weather / time of day (if affects gameplay)
- [ ] Level metadata (map name, game mode, player count)
