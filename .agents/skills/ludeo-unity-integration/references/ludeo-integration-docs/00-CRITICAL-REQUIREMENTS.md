## 🔑 KEY CONCEPT: Ludeo Session vs Gameplay Session

| | Ludeo Session | Gameplay Session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What** | SDK connection to the Ludeo backend | One playable moment (level, match, run) |
| **Type** | `LudeoSession` | `LudeoGameplaySession` |
| **Lifetime** | Entire app run | One gameplay instance |
| **Count** | ONE per app launch | MANY per app launch |
| **Created** | `LudeoManager.InitLudeoSession` → `LudeoSession.Activate` at startup (e.g. `SceneInit`) | `LudeoSession.OpenRoom` → `LudeoRoom.AddGamePlayer` → `LudeoGameplaySession.Begin` when a level starts |
| **Ended** | Session released at app shutdown | `LudeoGameplaySession.End` / `Abort` when the moment ends |

```
App Launch ──► [Ludeo Session Active] ──► App Quit
                     │
                     ├── SceneLevel run 1 ──► [Gameplay Session 1] ──► End
                     ├── SceneLevel run 2 ──► [Gameplay Session 2] ──► End
                     └── …
```

## 🔴 CR-001: The integration must be cleanly disableable (runtime dummies; compile-time define is optional)

> **Not a C-macro translation.** In Unity the SDK package is **auto-referenced once installed** —
> there is no build script and no required define. "Disabling Ludeo" is therefore **primarily a
> runtime concern**, which is how the reference integration actually works.

**Required (primary, runtime):** route *all* SDK use through interfaces so that when consent is
unavailable or the SDK can't initialize, `Dummy*`/`Disabled*` implementations make every call a
no-op and **the game plays normally**. The flow switch selects them (see CR-012 and
[`unity/REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md`](./unity/REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md)).

```csharp
ILudeoGameplaySessionManager mgr = consentAllows                // [Layer]
    ? new LudeoGameplaySessionManager(data)     // [Layer] real
    : new DummyLudeoGameplaySessionManager();    // [Layer] no-ops — game unaffected
```

**Optional (compile-time):** a Scripting Define Symbol (e.g. `LUDEO_SDK`) is needed **only if you
must ship a build that excludes the SDK package entirely** (an unsupported platform, a stripped
build). Then guard `using LudeoSDK` code with `#if LUDEO_SDK … #else …(fallback types)… #endif`.
Most integrations never need this — keep the package installed and rely on the runtime switch.

**Validation:**
- [ ] All SDK access goes through interfaces with `Dummy*`/`Disabled*` fallbacks (the flow switch).
- [ ] With consent off / SDK uninitialized, the game **runs and plays normally** (dummies no-op).
- [ ] *(Only if shipping no-SDK builds)* compiles with the package removed behind the optional define.

## ⚪ CR-002: Context stack — **N/A in Unity (handled by the plugin)**

The C++ requirement to pair `EnterObject`/`LeaveObject` does not exist here.
`LudeoStateObject.SetAttribute(...)` manages the object context internally. **Do nothing** — just
create a `LudeoStateObject` and set attributes on it.

---

## 🔴 CR-003: Async operations are callback-driven

Every async SDK call returns `void` and reports its result through an `Action<…CallbackData>`. Check
`data.resultCode == LudeoResult.Success` **inside the callback**.

**Async ops:** `LudeoSession.Activate`, `OpenRoom`, `GetLudeo`; `LudeoRoom.AddGamePlayer`,
`RemoveGameplayer`, `CloseRoom`; `LudeoGameplaySession.Begin`, `End`, `Abort`.

**Required:**
```csharp
session.Activate(data => {                                       // [SDK]
    if (data.resultCode != LudeoResult.Success) { Debug.LogError($"Activate failed: {data.resultCode}"); return; }  // [Unity] Debug.LogError
    // activated — and check data.isLudeoSelected to branch into the play flow
});
```

**Forbidden:** treating the call as if it returned a result — there is no synchronous return value.

---

## ⚪ CR-004: Window handle — **N/A in Unity (handled by the plugin)**

The plugin manages the capture surface/window. There is no window handle to pass.

---

## 🔴 CR-005: Do NOT wire SDK Tick — drive your own attribute sampling

The plugin instantiates a `LudeoUnityManager` that drives the SDK's internal tick. **You must not
call any SDK tick.** What you *do* drive each frame, while a gameplay session is active, is your own
attribute sampling — looping your `ILudeoStateHandler`s and writing current values.

**Required:**
```csharp
void Update() {
#if LUDEO_SDK
    if (m_gameplayActive)
        LudeoController.Instance.UpdateStateObjects(); // [Layer] calls SetAttribute on each tracked object
#endif
}
```

**Rules:** sample on a consistent cadence (per-frame, throttled, or on-change), on the **main
thread**. Do not look for a "main loop" to insert a Ludeo tick — Unity has none and the plugin ticks
itself.

---

## 🔴 CR-006: Two-pass restoration is MANDATORY

Restore in two passes so cross-object references resolve.

**Required:**
```csharp
// PASS 1 — create every GameObject from the restore buckets (by objectType)
foreach (var entry in bucket)             // bucket = LudeoStateObjectsLookup[objectType]  [Layer]
    Instantiate(...);                     // [Unity] create, register id → object

// PASS 2 — read attributes and resolve references (now every object exists)
foreach (var (obj, restore) in created) {
    restore.TryGetAttribute("health", out int hp);   // [SDK]
    // resolve cross-refs by YOUR stored key attribute, not by SDK ObjectId
}
```

**Why:** single-pass breaks when object B references object A that isn't spawned yet.

> **Reset matched/singleton instances before applying** (player/restore flow only — creator flow plays from
> the game's own fresh start and needs none of this). Pass 1 *spawns* fresh objects (zero-initialized), but the
> **player singleton** and any **scene-placed object you match instead of spawn** (`07 §9`) are the same live
> objects from the previous run — apply overwrites only the captured fields, so **uncaptured gameplay *and
> visual* state leaks across runs:** not just logical fields (inventory, ammo, score, buffs, cooldowns, status
> flags) but **everything visually relevant** that rides on a `DontDestroyOnLoad`/manager object and survives
> the scene reload — persistent HUD/score readouts, active VFX/particle emitters, world-space damage numbers,
> screen-shake, post-processing (vignette/bloom from a prior buff). Reset the instance to a clean baseline at
> the top of its restore apply, *then* apply the snapshot. (Distinct from the persistent-singleton *pause-flag*
> trap below — same cause, different victim.)

## 🔴 CR-007: `End`/`Abort` the gameplay session on **ALL** exit paths

> **⚠️ THE #1 CAUSE OF BROKEN INTEGRATIONS.** Miss one exit path → no Ludeo for that scenario.

**Every way to leave active gameplay must route through `LudeoController.EndGameplay(...)` or
`AbortGameplay(...)`** (the tank-pattern facade centralizes this).

**Audit ALL of these Unity exit paths:**

| Exit path | Example | Must end the session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level complete / win | `OnLevelComplete()` | ✅ End |
| Level failed / death | `OnPlayerDied()`, `GameOverMenu` | ✅ End |
| Quit to menu | `ReturnToMainMenu()`, pause-menu button | ✅ Abort |
| Restart level | `RestartLevel()` | ✅ Abort |
| Quit app | `OnApplicationQuit()` | ✅ End/Abort |
| Scene unload | `OnDestroy()` of the gameplay manager / scene teardown | ✅ End/Abort |
| `ReturnToMainMenu` notification | SDK overlay "exit to menu" | ✅ Abort + close room |
| `LudeoSelected` while a run is active (mid-capture **or finishing a replay to play another**) | player picks a Ludeo mid-run or a second Ludeo from the overlay | ✅ **Abort session** + stop tracking + close room + **reset begin-gate / both pause flags / gameplay-active** (07 §2.2) |

**Validation:**
- [ ] Listed every function/scene-exit/notification that leaves gameplay.
- [ ] Each routes through `EndGameplay`/`AbortGameplay`.
- [ ] Tested: quit mid-level → Ludeo created · restart → handled · return-to-menu → handled.

---

## ⚪ CR-008: Release ObjectsInfo — **N/A in Unity (handled by the plugin)**

`LudeoDataReader.GetStateObjects` returns a **managed** `LudeoStateObjectRestore[]`. There is nothing
to release; GC handles it. No `ObjectsInfo_Release` equivalent.

---

## 🔴 CR-009: Callback-driven operations are NOT game integration points

Some operations are triggered by SDK callbacks/notifications, not by your game events.

**🎮 Game code calls these:** `InitLudeoSession` (startup), `Activate` (after init),
`OpenRoom` (gameplay start), `End`/`Abort` (all exit paths), session release (shutdown).

**📞 Driven by callbacks/notifications (do NOT call from game event handlers):**

| Operation | Called from |
| --- | --- |
| `LudeoRoom.AddGamePlayer` | the `OpenRoom` callback (`HandleLudeoRoomOpened`) |
| `LudeoGameplaySession.Begin` | after the room is ready **and** the player added — **both** of `RoomReady` and the `AddGamePlayer` callback, which **race** |
| `LudeoRoom.CloseRoom` | after `End`/`Abort` completes, or on `ReturnToMainMenu` |

**Forbidden:** calling `OpenRoom` then immediately `AddGamePlayer`/`Begin` from the same level-load
handler — the room/player aren't ready yet. Chain them through the callbacks.

> **⚠️ `RoomReady` and the `AddGamePlayer` callback race — `Begin` requires BOTH.** They are
> independent async events with no ordering guarantee. Calling `Begin` from `RoomReady` alone fails
> whenever `RoomReady` wins (the gameplay session is still null → the run records nothing) — and it's
> intermittent, so it survives a first smoke test. Gate `Begin` so it fires only once both have
> completed (whichever is last), or fetch the session in the `RoomReady` handler via
> `LudeoRoom.GetGamePlaySession`. See `unity/REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

> **⚠️ For *restore*, the gate is a THIRD leg: the gameplay scene must be loaded too.** RoomReady is
> independent of `SceneManager` — applying restored state on RoomReady while the scene is still loading
> writes into an empty scene. The game must signal scene-load completion (`NotifySceneReadyForRestore()`),
> which usually means adding an awaitable/event to an `async void` scene loader. Gate = `RoomReady ∧
> AddGamePlayer ∧ sceneLoaded`. **`sceneLoaded` means the scene is *fully assembled* — apply done, async
> spawns settled, sim frozen-ready — not merely scene-activated; fire `NotifySceneReadyForRestore()` only
> then, and keep the scene covered until it, so the player never resumes onto a level still assembling
> (07 §2.1 invariant 5 / §10.1).** See CR-010 and `unity/REFERENCE-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

→ See [`05-LIFECYCLE-MANAGEMENT.md`](./05-LIFECYCLE-MANAGEMENT.md) for the callback flow.

## 🔴 CR-010: Protect restored state until `Begin` — apply, *then* unfreeze, *then* `Begin`

> **⚠️ #1 RESTORATION FAILURE:** "loads the right level, but the game keeps running and the restored
> state is wrong." (And its async twin: "the restore **hangs forever** and `Begin` never fires.")

Nothing — player input, AI, or a live `Update`/`FixedUpdate` — may overwrite the restored snapshot before
`Begin` starts recording. **Two mechanisms, and the apply's shape decides which:**

- **Synchronous apply** (`Instantiate` + setters, no awaits) → **freeze** the whole apply with
  `Time.timeScale = 0f` (pause audio too if needed). Order: **apply (while frozen) → `Begin` → unfreeze.**
- **Async apply** (awaits a physics step, coroutine/`UniTask` spawn, NavMesh `Warp`/bake) → **`Time.timeScale = 0f`
  does NOT run `FixedUpdate`, so a frozen async apply DEADLOCKS** (silent hang, not a crash). Instead
  **suppress** the state-mutating systems (input, AI trees, cinematics) via `IsInLudeoFlow` while the sim
  runs, apply a **narrow freeze only around the synchronous scalar write**, then unfreeze → `Begin`. Here
  suppression — not the freeze — is the overwrite guard. Full hybrid in
  [`07-RESTORATION-PATTERNS.md`](./07-RESTORATION-PATTERNS.md) §10.1.

**Sequence:**
1. `LudeoSelected` fires → set the `IsInLudeoFlow` "restoring" flag **first** (gates pre-match cutscenes/
   countdowns/default spawns), tear down any active session/room, suppress input.
2. `Time.timeScale = 0f` and **start loading** the level scene — kicked from the `onBeginRestore`
   selection-time hook (before the room opens); pre-match sequences skip due to the flag.
3. Cache the `LudeoDataReader` from the `GetLudeo` callback. **Do not apply yet.**
4. Player presses Play → SDK runs `OpenRoom → AddGamePlayer → RoomReady`. Begin waits on **all three** of
   RoomReady ∧ AddGamePlayer ∧ **scene-loaded** (CR-009).
5. **In the `RoomReady` handler:** apply state (Pass 1 + Pass 2 + environment) → unfreeze →
   `LudeoGameplaySession.Begin` (sync apply may fold unfreeze into `Begin`'s callback). **Apply is never
   preceded by an unfreeze.**

**Forbidden:** applying state in the `GetLudeo` callback (before `RoomReady`); calling `Begin` before the
apply; **unfreezing before the apply runs** (live frames mid-restore); **`Time.timeScale = 0f` around an
awaited spawn** (deadlock); pausing input only while physics/AI keep running during a *synchronous* apply.

→ See [`07-RESTORATION-PATTERNS.md`](./07-RESTORATION-PATTERNS.md) §10.

## 🔴 CR-011: While the Ludeo overlay is active during playback, pause the game

> **⚠️ #1 MID-PLAY FAILURE:** "the overlay covers a game that's still playing itself."

Distinct from CR-010 (the one-time post-load freeze). This is the ongoing contract: overlay opens →
pause; overlay closes → resume. Register the notifications **once at session creation**.

**Required:**
```csharp
session.AddNotifyPauseGame(()  => Time.timeScale = 0f);   // [SDK] + [Unity] — NOT AddNotifyPauseGameRequest
session.AddNotifyResumeGame(() => Time.timeScale = 1f);    // [SDK] + [Unity] — NOT AddNotifyResumeGameRequest
```

**Forbidden:** not registering the notifications; suppressing input only; conflating with CR-010.
Note both callbacks are a plain `Action` (no data struct). Handlers must be idempotent across
repeated open/close toggles.

> **Persistent-singleton trap:** the CR-010 freeze and CR-011 pause flags must **start `false` each run**.
> When the integration layer is a persistent singleton (`ScriptableObject` service / `DontDestroyOnLoad` /
> `static`), its fields survive across Editor playmode sessions **and across replays within one session** — a
> pause flag left `true` last run silently holds `timeScale = 0`, so a freshly-restored Ludeo loads but never
> unfreezes (looks like dead input; on an async restore it **deadlocks**, §10.1). Reset both flags (and other
> mutable runtime state) at a deterministic lifecycle start — **and again at the start of every restore**, since
> a replay→replay re-enters restore without re-running bootstrap (07 §2.2/§10.3). Never assume zero-init. See
> [`unity/CONSENT-AND-OVERLAY.md`](./unity/CONSENT-AND-OVERLAY.md) §3 and
> [`07-RESTORATION-PATTERNS.md`](./07-RESTORATION-PATTERNS.md) §2.2/§10.3–10.4.

---

## 🟢 CR-012 (Unity): Respect consent — `canCreateLudeo` / `canPlayLudeo`

Register `AddNotifyConsentUpdated`. Gate behaviour on the flags:

```csharp
session.AddNotifyConsentUpdated(data => {                 // [SDK]
    // data.canCreateLudeo, data.canPlayLudeo
    bool sdkUsable = data.canCreateLudeo || data.canPlayLudeo;
    galleryButton.SetActive(sdkUsable);    // [Unity] hide gallery if neither
});
```
- Don't open a room **for create** unless `canCreateLudeo`; don't open **for play** unless
  `canPlayLudeo`. If both are false the user opted out — treat the SDK as disabled this run.

→ See [`unity/CONSENT-AND-OVERLAY.md`](./unity/CONSENT-AND-OVERLAY.md).

---

## 🟢 CR-013 (Unity): Touch Unity and the SDK on the main thread

The plugin marshals its callbacks to the main thread, so it's safe to touch GameObjects inside Ludeo
callbacks. If your game uses coroutines/`async`/Jobs/worker threads, **marshal back to the main
thread** before calling the SDK or mutating GameObjects (e.g. via a main-thread dispatcher).

---

## 🟢 CR-014 (Unity, conditional): Stable identity only when re-binding to persistent entities

`GetInstanceID()` and object references are **not stable across runs** — never use them to match
captured to restored objects. Restoration matches by **`ObjectType` bucket**.

- **Default (spawn-from-bucket):** create fresh GameObjects from the restored entries; no stable id
  needed.
- **Only if** you must re-bind a restored entry to a specific pre-existing/persistent entity: store
  your own stable id **as an attribute** at capture and match on it at restore.

---

## 📊 Validation checklist

- **CR-001:** all SDK access behind interfaces; game **plays normally** with consent off (dummies); compile-time define only if shipping no-package builds.
- **CR-003:** every async call checks `resultCode` inside its callback.
- **CR-005:** no SDK tick wired; attribute sampling runs per active-gameplay frame on the main thread.
- **CR-006:** Pass 1 creates all objects; Pass 2 reads attributes + resolves refs by your keys. Reset matched/singleton instances (player) to baseline before applying — they kept the prior run's gameplay **and visual** state (HUD/VFX/post-fx included).
- **CR-007 (⚠️):** every gameplay exit path routes through `End`/`Abort`; tested quit/restart/menu.
- **CR-009:** `AddGamePlayer`/`Begin`/`CloseRoom` only from their driving callbacks; restore `Begin` gates on RoomReady ∧ AddGamePlayer ∧ scene-loaded.
- **CR-010 (⚠️):** restoring-flag first → start load (onBeginRestore) → freeze → cache reader → on RoomReady **apply → unfreeze → Begin** (never unfreeze before apply; never `timeScale=0` around an awaited spawn — suppress instead).
- **CR-011 (⚠️):** `AddNotifyPauseGame`/`AddNotifyResumeGame` registered at session creation; freeze sim.
- **CR-012:** consent flags gate create/play and the gallery button.
- **CR-013:** SDK/GameObject access on the main thread.
- **CR-014:** no cross-run instance ids; stable-id-as-attribute only when re-binding.
- **N/A (handled by plugin):** CR-002 (context stack), CR-004 (window handle), CR-008 (release info).
