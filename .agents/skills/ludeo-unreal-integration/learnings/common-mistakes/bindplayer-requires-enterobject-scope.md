# BindPlayer requires an active EnterObject scope — calling it standalone causes SDK error

Calling `WritableObj.BindPlayer(PlayerID)` outside of an `EnterObject` scope produces this SDK error:

```
[Ludeo] Data: Error: DataWriter0: Ludeo::DataWriter::setPlayerBinding failed because of missing ludeo_DataWriter_EnterObject call.
```

This means the player perspective is never bound to the writable object, so the SDK doesn't know whose POV the data belongs to.

**Wrong pattern (produces SDK error):**
```cpp
// In RegisterEntity(), after CreateObject:
WritableObj.BindPlayer(TCHAR_TO_UTF8(*PlayerID));  // ERROR: no EnterObject active
```

**Correct pattern (Lyra reference):**
```cpp
// In WritePlayerState(), per-frame with scoped guards:
const FScopedLudeoDataReadWriteEnterObjectGuard<FLudeoWritableObject> ObjectGuard(*WritableObj);
const FScopedWritableObjectBindPlayerGuard<FLudeoWritableObject> BindGuard(*WritableObj, TCHAR_TO_UTF8(*PlayerID));
// ... write data ...
// Guards auto-cleanup on scope exit
```

**How to apply:** Never call `BindPlayer` standalone after `CreateObject`. Always use `FScopedWritableObjectBindPlayerGuard` inside a `FScopedLudeoDataReadWriteEnterObjectGuard` scope during per-frame writes. The Phase 03 reference file's one-time BindPlayer pattern is incorrect and produces this error.

**Detection:** Search logs for `setPlayerBinding failed` — if present, BindPlayer is being called outside EnterObject scope.
