Do not rely on implicit state detection (e.g., player health > 0) for the N-way gate's gameplay-active condition. Instead, require an explicit game phase enum (e.g., `Loading`, `Playing`, `Dead`, `Respawning`) in the core game. The Ludeo component reads this enum for reliable phase gating.

Reviewer flagged implicit health-based detection as fragile — it doesn't account for loading, warmup, or transition states.
