question: "Does the game show a load-progress / intro / 'tip' overlay on level entry that appears in cloud replays (and often PAUSES the game while up)?

# Suppress a non-ludeoable load/intro overlay in Player Flow by replicating its own dismiss

## Precondition

A level-entry overlay (load-progress screen, intro/briefing, "tip of the day") shows when the
playable level loads. It appears in **cloud replays** (real cold packaged load on the streamer makes
it visible; local fast/warm/PIE loads skip past it), it's unwanted in a Ludeo, and it commonly
**pauses the game** while up (`SetGamePaused`). You want it gone for Player-Flow replays.

## Why not "prevent it from showing"

The create/show site is usually buried in a data-driven UI/HUD manager and hard to pin (forward BP
graph tools can't always find it). You don't need it. The overlay is a known widget class, so in
Player Flow you can **dismiss it after it appears** — robust regardless of who showed it.

## The pattern

In the Player-Flow wait loop (each poll while waiting for the battle/level to set up), find the
overlay instance and do **exactly what its Continue/close button does**:

```cpp
for (TObjectIterator<UUserWidget> It; It; ++It)
{
    if (It->GetWorld() != World || !IsClassDerivedFrom(It->GetClass(), TEXT("WBP_<Overlay>_C")))
        continue;
    BroadcastMulticastDelegateNoParams(*It, TEXT("OnContinueClick")); // replicate the button (param-less)
    It->RemoveFromParent();                                            // remove the widget
}
if (bRemovedAny && World->IsPaused())
    UGameplayStatics::SetGamePaused(World, false);                     // it paused the game — undo it
```

Three parts matter:
1. **Replicate the dismiss, don't just hide it.** Firing the overlay's own param-less dismiss
   delegate (broadcast it via reflection — guarded to *only* fire if the signature has no params, so
   you can't pass a mismatched frame) lets the game's own continue/proceed logic run. `RemoveFromParent`
   is the visual backstop.
2. **Undo the pause.** These overlays usually `SetGamePaused(true)`. If you only remove the widget,
   the game can stay paused — which **stalls a Player-Flow restore that waits *unpaused* for setup**.
   So this isn't only cosmetic; it can be required for the replay to proceed.
3. **Do it in the wait loop**, so it's killed the moment it appears (it can show before your component
   even exists, or persist waiting for a click).

Gate the whole thing on `bIsPlayerFlow` — the overlay is part of the real player's experience during
Creator capture; only the replay should suppress it.

## How to identify the overlay (when you don't know which widget)

The on-screen text maps straight to the owning widget via the localization `.po` files: grep the
exact text the user saw (e.g. a tip line) in `Content/Localization/.../Game.po`; the `SourceLocation`
field names the widget path. Faster and surer than booting the editor to hunt BP graphs.

## Cross-reference

- `architecture/zero-arg-bind-to-bp-event-dispatcher-via-reflection.md` — the bind counterpart; this
  uses the *broadcast* counterpart (`BroadcastMulticastDelegateNoParams`, param-guarded).
- `architecture/pause-menu-non-ludeoable.md` / non-ludeoable handling — same family of concern.
