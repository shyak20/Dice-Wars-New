# Racing Genre Patterns (Unreal)

> **Applies to:** Arcade Racers, Sim Racing, Kart Racers, Time-Trial, Combat Racing
> **Load when:** Game involves vehicles, lap-based or point-to-point tracks, position/ranking against
> opponents, lap/race timing
>
> Action names below map to the Ludeo subsystem / DataWriter `SendAction` call (see
> `references/phase-05-actions.md` and `references/sdk-reference/`).

> **MVP scope (curated-first):** In Phases 3–5, treat this catalog as a menu — implement only the
> actions/objects present in your **curated slice** (`integration.json → curatedSlice`). The full
> catalog applies at **expansion** (Phase 7), when coverage broadens to the whole game.

> **Unreal idioms** (engine-API hooks to grep in C++/Blueprint):
> - **Checkpoints / laps:** `OnComponentBeginOverlap` on trigger volumes.
> - **Collisions:** `OnComponentHit`, `NotifyHit`, `ReceiveHit`.
> - **Vehicle dynamics:** `UChaosVehicleMovementComponent` /
>   `UChaosWheeledVehicleMovementComponent` (Chaos Vehicles) — throttle/brake/steering inputs.
> - **Events:** multicast delegates, `UFUNCTION` `On*`/`Handle*`.

## 3. Tracking Checklist

After object tracking is implemented (phase 3/4), verify these are covered. Types map to the
Unreal DataWriter set-attribute calls; see `references/phase-04-tracking-restore.md` and
`references/phase-05-actions.md` for the exact API.

### Player Vehicle (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Position (`FVector`)
- [ ] Rotation (`FRotator`)
- [ ] Velocity / speed (`FVector` or scalar)
- [ ] Current lap number
- [ ] Current race position / rank
- [ ] Lap / sector times (current + best)
- [ ] Track progress (lap distance / spline position)
- [ ] Boost / nitro charge
- [ ] Vehicle damage / condition
- [ ] Fuel / tire state (sim racers)

### Opponents / AI Racers
- [ ] Position, rotation
- [ ] Velocity / speed
- [ ] Current lap number
- [ ] Race position / rank
- [ ] Track progress
- [ ] Racer / driver ID
- [ ] AI difficulty / behavior state
- [ ] Held item (kart racers)

### Race State
- [ ] Race phase (countdown, racing, finished)
- [ ] Total laps
- [ ] Elapsed race time
- [ ] Full standings / running order
- [ ] Active penalties (per racer)

### Items / Pickups (kart racers)
- [ ] Position
- [ ] Item type
- [ ] Is collected / available
- [ ] Respawn state (if applicable)
- [ ] Active projectiles (type, owner, position, velocity)

### Track / Environment
- [ ] Track / circuit ID
- [ ] Checkpoint states (per racer)
- [ ] Weather / track surface conditions (if affects gameplay)
- [ ] Time of day / lighting
- [ ] Level metadata (track name, race mode, lap count, opponent count)
