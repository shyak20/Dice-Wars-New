# RPG Genre Patterns (Unreal)

> **Applies to:** Action RPGs, open-world RPGs (Daggerfall, Skyrim/Fallout-likes, Witcher-likes),
> JRPGs with real-time combat, MMORPGs, looter-RPGs (Diablo-likes)
> **Load when:** Game involves character stats/leveling, quests, inventory/equipment, dialogue, or
> faction/reputation systems
>
> **Most RPGs are also open-world / streaming.** If the game has no per-level scenes, load
> [open-world.md](references/game-patterns/open-world.md) (session boundaries) and
> [open-world-tracking.md](references/game-patterns/open-world-tracking.md) (streaming-world tracking) **alongside** this
> file — this file is the genre catalog; those are the structural shape.
>
> Action names below map to the Ludeo subsystem / DataWriter `SendAction` call (see
> `references/phase-05-actions.md` and `references/sdk-reference/`).

> **MVP scope (curated-first):** In Phases 3–5, treat this catalog as a menu — implement only the
> actions/objects present in your **curated slice** (`integration.json → curatedSlice`). The full
> catalog applies at **expansion** (Phase 7), when coverage broadens to the whole game.

## 3. Tracking Checklist

After object tracking is implemented (phase 3/4), verify these are covered. Types map to the
Unreal DataWriter set-attribute calls; see `references/phase-04-tracking-restore.md` and
`references/phase-05-actions.md` for the exact API. For streaming worlds, also apply
[open-world-tracking.md](references/game-patterns/open-world-tracking.md) (track the loaded neighborhood + world/cell state,
not the whole save).

### Player (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Position (`FVector`), Rotation (`FRotator`)
- [ ] Health / HP, Mana / Magicka, Stamina/Fatigue (`int`/`float`)
- [ ] Is alive/dead (`bool`)
- [ ] Level, XP, attributes/skills (current values)
- [ ] Equipped gear (weapon, armor — by item/content id, not reference)
- [ ] Inventory (array of item ids + counts; never object references — `06 §9.4`)
- [ ] Gold / currency
- [ ] Current region/cell id (open-world)
- [ ] Faction reputation / standing

### NPCs / Enemies
- [ ] Position, rotation, health
- [ ] AI state (idle, combat, fleeing, schedule) — typically `AAIController` + Behavior Tree + state enum
- [ ] Disposition / faction / is-hostile
- [ ] Target entity (by stable key)
- [ ] Dialogue/quest state if it gates behavior
- [ ] Is alive/dead (a killed-not-respawned NPC is a **state flag**, not just an unregister — `06 §9.4`)

### Quests / World State
- [ ] Active quest ids + current stage/objective (as their own objectType)
- [ ] World/global flags that affect the visible moment
- [ ] Game-time, weather, season (a `WorldState` singleton — `open-world-tracking.md §3`)

### Items / Containers / World objects
- [ ] Dropped/world items: position, item type, owner key
- [ ] Containers/chests: opened/looted state, contents
- [ ] Doors / locks: open, locked state
- [ ] Lootable corpses: looted state
