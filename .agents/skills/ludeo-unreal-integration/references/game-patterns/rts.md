# RTS Genre Patterns (Unreal)

> **Applies to:** Real-Time Strategy, Tower Defense, Base Builders, MOBA (partial)
> **Load when:** Game involves unit production, base building, resource management, strategic combat
>
> Action names below map to the Ludeo subsystem / DataWriter `SendAction` call (see
> `references/phase-05-actions.md` and `references/sdk-reference/`).

> **MVP scope (curated-first):** In Phases 3–5, treat this catalog as a menu — implement only the
> actions/objects present in your **curated slice** (`integration.json → curatedSlice`). The full
> catalog applies at **expansion** (Phase 7), when coverage broadens to the whole game.

> **Unreal idioms** (engine-API hooks to grep in C++/Blueprint):
> - **Selection / orders:** cursor picks via `GetHitResultUnderCursorByChannel` /
>   `LineTraceSingleByChannel`; input bound in `SetupInputComponent` (`BindAction`); per-actor
>   click via the `AActor` `OnClicked` delegate (Click Events enabled on the player controller).
> - **Produce / destroy:** `UWorld::SpawnActor`, `AActor::Destroy`.
> - **Unit movement / AI:** `AAIController`, `MoveTo`, `UNavMovementComponent`, Behavior Tree.
> - **Events:** multicast delegates (`DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE`), `UFUNCTION` `On*`/`Handle*`.

## 3. Tracking Checklist

After object tracking is implemented (phase 3/4), verify these are covered. Types map to the
Unreal DataWriter set-attribute calls; see `references/phase-04-tracking-restore.md` and
`references/phase-05-actions.md` for the exact API.

### Player State (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Resources (each type: gold, wood, etc.)
- [ ] Population / supply (current and cap)
- [ ] Tech level / age / era
- [ ] Score
- [ ] Team / faction

### Units
- [ ] Position (`FVector`)
- [ ] Unit type / actor class
- [ ] Health / HP
- [ ] Owner / player ID
- [ ] Current order / AI state (idle, moving, attacking, gathering) — typically `AAIController` + state enum / Behavior Tree
- [ ] Target entity ID
- [ ] Is alive

### Structures / Buildings
- [ ] Position
- [ ] Building type
- [ ] Health
- [ ] Owner / player ID
- [ ] Build progress (0.0 to 1.0)
- [ ] Is complete
- [ ] Upgrade level
- [ ] Production queue (if producing units)

### Resources / Economy
- [ ] Resource node positions
- [ ] Resource node remaining amount
- [ ] Player resource totals (each type)

### Map / Territory
- [ ] Control point ownership
- [ ] Fog of war state (per player)
- [ ] Explored areas

### Environment
- [ ] Destructible terrain (if applicable)
- [ ] Weather / time of day (if affects gameplay)
- [ ] Level metadata (map name, game mode, player count)
